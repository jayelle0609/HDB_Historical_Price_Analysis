# 🏠 HDB Resale Price Forecasting Project

This is my GitHub Repository, where I have uploaded my Python code used to clean, merge, validate and visualize the data.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project aims to analyze and forecast HDB resale prices in Singapore using historical data. The workflow has starts in Python and ends in Tableau:

## A. Python Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Merging multiple datasets from Data.gov.sg.
- Handling missing values and inconsistent formats.
- Feature engineering (e.g., lease years left, inflation adjustment).

---

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualizing trends and distributions of resale prices by year, flat type, town, model, and storey range.
- Adjusting prices for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- Highlighting key economic events and their impact on prices.

---

### 3. **Forecasting**
- Build a Random Forest Regression model to to predict future HDB prices based on user-selected features, adjusted for CPI inflation.
- CPI values were forecasted with linear regression.
- [Deployed the model on a web app for user predictions](streamlit.com).
- CHECK MY MODEL OUT!!! 🕺🕺😊😊

---

### 4. **Visualization**
- Creating insightful plots in Python and Tableau to identify factors affecting HDB resale prices.
